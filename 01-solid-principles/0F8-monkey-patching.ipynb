    "### What is **Monkey Patching**?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Monkey patching** is a concept in programming where you **modify or extend** existing classes or modules at **runtime**, often by changing the behavior of methods or attributes. This technique allows you to make changes to code that you don't have direct control over, usually in a third-party library or module, without modifying the original source code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, **monkey patching** is like **hacking** or **modifying** a piece of code while it's running, without directly changing the source code files. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What Topic Does Monkey Patching Come Under?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dynamic Typing:** Since it’s done at runtime, it falls under dynamic typing. Monkey patching is common in **dynamically typed** languages like **Python** and **Ruby**, where types are determined at runtime and objects can be modified at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Metaprogramming:** Monkey patching is a form of **metaprogramming**, which refers to writing programs that can manipulate their own code during execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use of Monkey Patching\n",
    "\n",
    "Monkey patching can be useful in several situations:\n",
    "1. **Bug Fixes:** If a third-party library has a bug, you can patch it quickly without waiting for the library authors to release a fix.\n",
    "2. **Adding Features:** You might want to add functionality to a library or module without modifying its source code.\n",
    "3. **Fixing Compatibility Issues:** If you're using an older version of a library or a library that doesn’t support new features, you can monkey patch it to work with your existing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of Monkey Patching in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scenario: Adding a New Method to a String Class\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you want to add a new method `reverse()` to Python's built-in `str` class to reverse a string. You don't want to modify Python’s source code directly, so you use **monkey patching**.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Original String class (built-in in Python)\n",
    "text = \"hello\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Adding a new method 'reverse' to the str class using monkey patching\n",
    "def reverse(self):\n",
    "    return self[::-1]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Monkey patch the str class\n",
    "str.reverse = reverse\n",
    "\n",
    "# Now all string objects have access to this method\n",
    "print(text.reverse())  # Output: \"olleh\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Here, we added a `reverse()` method to Python's built-in `str` class using monkey patching.\n",
    "- Now, all `str` objects (like `text`) can call this method, even though `reverse()` was not originally part of the `str` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-life Examples of Monkey Patching\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Patching Third-party Libraries:**\n",
    "   Imagine you're working with an old third-party library that doesn't have support for a certain feature you need. Instead of waiting for the library’s author to update it, you can monkey patch it at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import some_old_library\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Suppose there's a bug in some_old_library that you want to fix\n",
    "   def fix_bug_in_library():\n",
    "       print(\"Fixing a bug!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "   some_old_library.some_method = fix_bug_in_library  # Monkey patch\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Mocking in Testing:**\n",
    "   Monkey patching is often used in **unit testing** to replace parts of a program during tests. For example, you might mock external API calls or database interactions using monkey patching, allowing tests to be run without needing to make real API requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import some_external_api\n",
    "\n",
    "   def mock_api_call():\n",
    "       return \"Mocked response\"\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Replace the actual function with the mock version\n",
    "   some_external_api.get_data = mock_api_call\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Now, the test will use the mock API call instead of the real one\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Legacy Code Modifications:**\n",
    "   When working with legacy systems or code you can't easily modify, you can monkey patch classes or methods to adjust their behavior without touching the original codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class LegacyClass:\n",
    "       def __init__(self):\n",
    "           self.old_value = 42\n",
    "\n",
    "       def old_method(self):\n",
    "           return self.old_value\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Imagine this is the legacy class from an old system\n",
    "   legacy_instance = LegacyClass()\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Monkey patch to fix a method's behavior\n",
    "   def new_method(self):\n",
    "       return self.old_value * 2\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Patch the method at runtime\n",
    "   LegacyClass.old_method = new_method\n",
    "\n",
    "   print(legacy_instance.old_method())  # Output: 84 (not the old behavior)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Should **Monkey Patching** Not Be Used?\n",
    "\n",
    "While **monkey patching** can be powerful and useful in some situations, it also comes with significant **downsides** and **risks**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Unpredictability:** Monkey patching modifies the behavior of objects at runtime. This can lead to **unpredictable results**, especially if different parts of the program or other libraries are modifying the same method.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Breaks Code in Future Versions:** If you patch a third-party library and the library authors fix the problem in a future version, your patch might conflict with the updated code, causing **bugs** or **errors**. So, your patch can break when you upgrade to a new version of the library.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Makes Code Harder to Debug:** Since the changes happen dynamically, it can be difficult for other developers (or even yourself) to understand what’s going on. If you or someone else revisits the code later, it might be hard to track down where and why certain methods or behaviors were changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Breaks Encapsulation:** Monkey patching often involves modifying the internals of a class or module, which breaks **encapsulation**—a core principle of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It can lead to a **tight coupling** between components, making the system harder to maintain and extend.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Possible Performance Overheads:** In some cases, applying monkey patches can introduce performance issues, especially if the patched methods are used extensively or in performance-critical parts of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Code that Relies on Monkey Patching is Hard to Maintain:** Monkey patches often **hide** underlying problems rather than fix them, leading to technical debt. It’s usually better to address the root cause of the issue rather than patching it.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### When Should You Avoid Monkey Patching?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **When Maintaining Code:** If you're working in a production codebase that others rely on, monkey patching should be used cautiously, as it can introduce unexpected behavior.\n",
    "- **When Extending Third-Party Libraries:** Instead of patching a third-party library, try to subclass or extend its functionality in a more **official** way. This makes your code clearer and less error-prone.\n",
    "- **When You Want Code That Is Readable and Understandable:** If your team (or anyone else) has to read and maintain your code, monkey patching can make the behavior confusing and harder to debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### In Summary:\n",
    "- **Monkey Patching** is modifying or extending a class or method at **runtime** without altering the original source code.\n",
    "- It is useful for **quick fixes**, **adding features**, or **mocking in tests**, but can introduce risks such as **unpredictability**, **maintenance challenges**, and **breakage** when upgrading libraries.\n",
    "- **Best practice:** If you must use it, keep the changes well-documented, and use monkey patching only when other alternatives are not viable. **Don’t overuse it**—only apply it when absolutely necessary."
