    "Sure! Here's a concise table of the **most commonly used design patterns** in software development, ordered by frequency and importance. Each design pattern comes with a brief explanation of what it is and where it's typically used.\n",
    "\n",
    "| **Design Pattern**         | **Type**              | **Description**                                                                                                                                                    | **Common Use Case**                                                                                               |\n",

    "| **Singleton**               | Creational            | Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.                                                                      | Used when you need exactly **one instance** (e.g., Database connection, Logging system).                         |\n",
    "| **Factory Method**         | Creational            | Defines an interface for creating objects, but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.                                                       | Used when you need to create objects from a family of related classes but don't want to specify the exact class.  |\n",
    "| **Abstract Factory**       | Creational            | Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.                                               | Used when your system needs to **work with multiple related families of objects** (e.g., UI components in different OS). |\n",
    "| **Builder**                | Creational            | Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.                    | Used when creating complex objects step by step, such as constructing a **house** or **vehicle**.               |\n",
    "| **Prototype**              | Creational            | Creates a new object by copying an existing object, which serves as a prototype.                                                                                     | Used when object creation is expensive and you want to create new objects by cloning existing ones.               |\n",
    "| **Observer**               | Behavioral            | Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, where a change in one object triggers updates in all dependent objects.                                            | Used in **event-driven systems** (e.g., GUI, notifications, or subscribing to updates like in a stock ticker).    |\n",
    "| **Strategy**               | Behavioral            | Defines a family of algorithms and allows them to be interchangeable. The client can choose which algorithm to use.                                                 | Used when you need to vary the behavior of an object without changing the object itself (e.g., sorting algorithms). |\n",
    "| **Command**                | Behavioral            | Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with different requests. It decouples the sender from the receiver.              | Used for **undo/redo** functionality, **menu systems**, or actions triggered by user inputs.                       |\n",
    "| **Decorator**              | Structural            | Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Used to **extend** its functionality without altering the object.                                      | Used for adding features to UI components (e.g., adding scrollbars to windows, adding validation to forms).       |\n",
    "| **Adapter**                | Structural            | Converts the interface of a class into another interface that a client expects. It allows classes with incompatible interfaces to work together.                      | Used when you need to integrate with **legacy systems** or external libraries without changing them.               |\n",
    "| **Facade**                 | Structural            | Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem. It hides the complexities of the subsystem and provides a higher-level interface.                           | Used to simplify a complex system or library (e.g., simplifying API calls, integration with multiple services).   |\n",
    "| **Composite**              | Structural            | Allows you to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. Useful for working with tree-like structures (e.g., file systems, organizational hierarchies). | Used in hierarchical structures (e.g., **filesystems**, **UI components** like trees or menus).                   |\n",
    "| **Proxy**                  | Structural            | Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object, controlling access to it.                                                                                  | Used for **lazy loading**, access control, logging, or caching (e.g., virtual proxies for heavy objects).         |\n",
    "| **State**                  | Behavioral            | Allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes. The object appears to change its class.                                                      | Used when an object needs to **change behavior based on its state**, like in **state machines**.                   |\n",
    "| **Chain of Responsibility**| Behavioral            | Passes a request along a chain of handlers. Each handler processes the request or passes it to the next handler in the chain.                                         | Used in handling a **series of actions** (e.g., in middleware, error handling, or logging frameworks).             |\n",
    "| **Memento**                | Behavioral            | Allows capturing and externalizing an object's state without affecting its behavior. It lets you restore the object to its previous state.                           | Used for **undo/redo** operations, like in **text editors** or game state saving.                                 |\n",
    "| **Mediator**               | Behavioral            | Defines an object that centralizes communication between a group of objects. It promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other directly.       | Used in systems where **components need to communicate** but shouldn't have direct dependencies (e.g., chat apps). |\n",
    "| **Template Method**        | Behavioral            | Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing the structure.                  | Used when you have a **fixed algorithm** but want flexibility in certain parts (e.g., document processing).        |\n",
    "| **Visitor**                | Behavioral            | Allows you to define new operations on elements of an object structure without changing the classes of the elements.                                                   | Used in systems where you need to apply **new operations** on existing data structures without modifying them.      |\n",
