    "### What is an **Abstract Method**?\n",
    "\n",
    "An **abstract method** is a method that is declared in an abstract class (or interface) but **does not have any implementation**. It serves as a **blueprint** for methods that must be implemented in **concrete subclasses**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you define an abstract method using the `@abstractmethod` decorator, which is part of the `abc` (Abstract Base Class) module. This marks the method as abstract, signaling that it must be overridden in any subclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hereâ€™s an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
    "\n",
    "class Animal(ABC):\n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Woof!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Meow!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Trying to instantiate an Animal directly would raise an error:\n",
    "# animal = Animal()  # This will raise TypeError\n",
    "\n",
    "dog = Dog()\n",
    "dog.speak()  # Output: Woof!\n",
    "\n",
    "cat = Cat()\n",
    "cat.speak()  # Output: Meow!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Characteristics of an Abstract Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **No implementation**: Abstract methods do not have any code in their body. They are just signatures, with no actual functionality.\n",
    "2. **Must be implemented in subclasses**: Any non-abstract subclass must implement all of its abstract methods.\n",
    "3. **Defined in abstract classes**: You cannot instantiate an abstract class directly (i.e., it cannot be used to create objects).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Are Abstract Methods Used?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Enforcing a common interface**: Abstract methods define a contract for subclasses. This ensures that all subclasses implement certain methods, providing a consistent interface. This is useful in scenarios where you want different classes to follow the same method structure but allow each subclass to provide its own implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Example**: In the `Animal` class above, the abstract method `speak` enforces that every subclass of `Animal` will implement `speak`, even though the specific behavior (the sound an animal makes) can vary.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Creating a template for subclasses**: When you create an abstract class with abstract methods, you're essentially defining a **template** that subclasses must follow. This provides a structure for the child classes, ensuring they implement the necessary behavior, but without dictating how that behavior should work.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Allowing polymorphism**: Abstract methods help enable **polymorphism** by defining methods that can be called on objects of different subclasses. Despite the concrete classes implementing the method differently, clients can call the same method without worrying about the specific subclass. This allows for flexibility and reusability of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Example**: In the `Animal` class, both `Dog` and `Cat` implement the `speak` method. You can treat both objects as instances of `Animal` and call `speak` on them without knowing which subclass is actually handling the request.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Preventing instantiation of incomplete classes**: Abstract classes with abstract methods cannot be instantiated directly. This helps prevent creating objects of a class that is incomplete and not meant to be used on its own. Only subclasses that provide implementations for all abstract methods can be instantiated.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Example**: Trying to create an instance of `Animal` directly (which is an abstract class) would result in an error, enforcing the rule that you must implement the abstract methods in a subclass before instantiating the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Enabling better code organization and readability**: Abstract methods can help organize code in a way that emphasizes the **intent** behind the class and methods, rather than focusing on their implementation. The abstract methods define what needs to be done, but the subclass defines how it should be done. This separation improves the clarity and maintainability of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Use Cases for Abstract Methods:\n",
    "- **Frameworks**: Abstract methods are often used in frameworks and libraries where a base class defines the structure, but the implementation is left up to the user (developer). The framework expects users to extend and implement the abstract methods as needed.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Strategy Pattern**: In design patterns like the **Strategy Pattern**, abstract methods are used to define a common interface for a set of interchangeable algorithms, allowing different strategies to be implemented in subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Template Method Pattern**: In the **Template Method Pattern**, an abstract class defines a high-level algorithm, leaving the implementation of certain steps to concrete subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Using Abstract Methods in the Context of the Original Code\n",
    "\n",
    "In your original code, you had the `RelationshipBrowser` class with the abstract method `find_all_children_of`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class RelationshipBrowser:\n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def find_all_children_of(self, name): \n",
    "        pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This abstract method defines a contract that any class implementing `RelationshipBrowser` must follow. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the `Relationships` class provides its own implementation of the abstract method:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Relationships(RelationshipBrowser):\n",
    "    relations = []\n",
    "\n",
    "    def add_parent_and_child(self, parent, child):\n",
    "        self.relations.append((parent, Relationship.PARENT, child))\n",
    "        self.relations.append((child, Relationship.PARENT, parent))\n",
    "\n",
    "    def find_all_children_of(self, name):\n",
    "        for r in self.relations:\n",
    "            if r[0].name == name and r[1] == Relationship.PARENT:\n",
    "                yield r[2].name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `find_all_children_of` method is **abstract** in the `RelationshipBrowser` class and is **implemented** in the `Relationships` class, allowing different subclasses of `RelationshipBrowser` to implement it differently based on how relationships are stored (e.g., in a database, a file, or memory).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the abstract method is used to enforce that any subclass of `RelationshipBrowser` must provide an implementation for `find_all_children_of`, ensuring that the high-level `Research` class can rely on this method without caring about how the relationships are stored or fetched.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### In Summary:\n",
    "- **An abstract method** is a method declared in an abstract class or interface with no implementation, forcing subclasses to provide their own specific implementation.\n",
    "- It is used to **enforce a contract** and ensure that certain methods are implemented in subclasses, to **create a common interface** for polymorphism, and to **provide a template** for the structure of a class.\n"
