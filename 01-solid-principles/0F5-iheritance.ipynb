    "Got it! Let's break down **inheritance** in programming step by step, and I’ll keep it simple, direct, and with examples. We’ll start with the basic concepts and then dive into each one with examples. Here’s what we’ll cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Concepts of Inheritance:**\n",
    "1. **Inheritance Basics**\n",
    "2. **Parent (Base) and Child (Derived) Classes**\n",
    "3. **Method Overloading**\n",
    "4. **Method Overriding**\n",
    "5. **Constructor Inheritance**\n",
    "6. **Access Modifiers and Inheritance**\n",
    "7. **Multilevel Inheritance**\n",
    "8. **Multiple Inheritance (specific to some languages)**\n",
    "9. **Method Resolution Order (MRO)**\n",
    "10. **Polymorphism**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Inheritance Basics:**\n",
    "- **What it is:** Inheritance allows a **child class** to **inherit** properties and behaviors (methods) from a **parent class**.\n",
    "- **Why it matters:** This promotes **code reusability** and **organization**. Instead of writing the same code multiple times, you can write it once in the parent class and then extend/modify it in child classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Parent (Base) and Child (Derived) Classes:**\n",
    "- **Parent Class:** A class that provides attributes and methods to other classes (also called a **base class**).\n",
    "- **Child Class:** A class that inherits from a parent class (also called a **derived class**).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Animal speaks\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):  # Dog inherits from Animal\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Woof!\")\n",
    "        \n",
    "dog = Dog()\n",
    "dog.speak()  # Output: Woof!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `Dog` is a child class of `Animal`. The `Dog` class inherits the method `speak` from the `Animal` class, but it also **overrides** it with its own version.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Method Overloading:**\n",
    "- **What it is:** In method overloading, a class can have **multiple methods** with the same name but different **parameters** (like number of arguments or their types).\n",
    "- **Key point:** **Python does not support traditional method overloading** like in other languages (Java, C++), but we can simulate it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example (Overloading in Java-like style):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Calculator:\n",
    "    def add(self, a, b=None):  # Overloaded method\n",
    "        if b is not None:\n",
    "            return a + b\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            return a + a\n",
    "\n",
    "calc = Calculator()\n",
    "print(calc.add(5))  # Output: 10 (5 + 5)\n",
    "print(calc.add(5, 3))  # Output: 8 (5 + 3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, the `add()` method has two versions: one with one parameter and one with two.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Method Overriding:**\n",
    "- **What it is:** When a **child class** provides a **specific implementation** of a method that is already defined in its **parent class**.\n",
    "- **Key point:** This allows the child class to **change the behavior** of inherited methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Animal speaks\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def speak(self):  # Overriding Animal's speak() method\n",
    "        print(\"Woof!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "dog = Dog()\n",
    "dog.speak()  # Output: Woof! (Overridden)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the `Dog` class **overrides** the `speak()` method of the `Animal` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Constructor Inheritance:**\n",
    "- **What it is:** Inheritance of **constructors** is a bit tricky. The constructor of the parent class is not inherited directly, but the child class can call the parent’s constructor using `super()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, breed):\n",
    "        super().__init__(name)  # Calling parent class constructor\n",
    "        self.breed = breed\n",
    "\n",
    "dog = Dog(\"Buddy\", \"Golden Retriever\")\n",
    "print(dog.name)   # Output: Buddy\n",
    "print(dog.breed)  # Output: Golden Retriever\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `Dog` class **inherits** the `__init__` method from `Animal` by using `super()`. The child class can add its own parameters as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Access Modifiers and Inheritance:**\n",
    "- **What it is:** Access modifiers like `public`, `protected`, and `private` determine how the methods and attributes of a class can be accessed in the derived class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "- **Public members**: Accessible anywhere.\n",
    "- **Protected members**: Accessible in the derived class (but not outside).\n",
    "- **Private members**: Not directly accessible in the derived class.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name  # public\n",
    "\n",
    "    def _protected_method(self):\n",
    "        print(\"This is protected.\")  # Protected method\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __private_method(self):\n",
    "        print(\"This is private.\")  # Private method\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def show_info(self):\n",
    "        print(self.name)  # Accessible\n",
    "        self._protected_method()  # Accessible\n",
    "        # self.__private_method()  # Error: Not accessible\n",
    "\n",
    "dog = Dog(\"Buddy\")\n",
    "dog.show_info()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Multilevel Inheritance:**\n",
    "- **What it is:** A class inherits from a child class, which itself inherits from another class, forming a **chain of inheritance**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Animal speaks\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Mammal(Animal):\n",
    "    def walk(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Mammal walks\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Mammal):\n",
    "    def bark(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Woof!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "dog = Dog()\n",
    "dog.speak()  # Inherited from Animal\n",
    "dog.walk()   # Inherited from Mammal\n",
    "dog.bark()   # From Dog\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `Dog` inherits from `Mammal`, and `Mammal` inherits from `Animal`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Multiple Inheritance (specific to some languages):**\n",
    "- **What it is:** In **multiple inheritance**, a class can inherit from **more than one class**.\n",
    "- **Python supports multiple inheritance**, but some languages like Java do not.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Animal speaks\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Vehicle:\n",
    "    def move(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Vehicle moves\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Robot(Animal, Vehicle):  # Inheriting from both Animal and Vehicle\n",
    "    def action(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Robot does something\")\n",
    "\n",
    "robot = Robot()\n",
    "robot.speak()  # From Animal\n",
    "robot.move()   # From Vehicle\n",
    "robot.action() # From Robot\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `Robot` inherits from both `Animal` and `Vehicle`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. **Method Resolution Order (MRO):**\n",
    "- **What it is:** When a method is called, Python uses the **Method Resolution Order (MRO)** to decide which method to call when multiple inheritance is involved. This is handled using the **C3 Linearization** algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class A:\n",
    "    def show(self):\n",
    "        print(\"A\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class B(A):\n",
    "    def show(self):\n",
    "        print(\"B\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class C(A):\n",
    "    def show(self):\n",
    "        print(\"C\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class D(B, C):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "d = D()\n",
    "d.show()  # Output: B (Method Resolution Order decides this)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses the **MRO** to decide which class’s `show()` method to call when multiple inheritance is involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. **Polymorphism (Related to Inheritance):**\n",
    "- **What it is:** Polymorphism means that the same method can behave differently depending on which class’s object calls it.\n",
    "- **How it works with inheritance:** A **child class** can override a method of the **parent class**, and the method call will use the version in the child class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Animal speaks\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Woof!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Meow!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "def animal_speak(animal):\n",
    "    animal.speak()\n",
    "\n",
    "a = Animal()\n",
    "d = Dog()\n",
    "c = Cat()\n",
    "\n",
    "animal_speak(a)  # Output: Animal speaks\n",
    "animal_speak(d)  # Output: Woof!\n",
    "animal_speak(c)  # Output: Meow!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, **polymorphism** allows `animal_speak()` to call different `speak()` methods based on whether the object is an `Animal`, `Dog`, or `Cat`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### To Recap:\n",
    "- **Inheritance** lets a child class inherit methods and attributes from a parent class.\n",
    "- **Method Overloading** means multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.\n",
    "- **Method Overriding** allows the child class to change a method from the parent class.\n",
    "- **Constructors**, **Access Modifiers**, **Multiple Inheritance**, and **Polymorphism** all play roles in inheritance to help code be more flexible and reusable.\n",

    "cat.speak()  # Output: Whiskers meows\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, `Dog` and `Cat` are **derived classes** of `Animal`. Both override the `speak()` method to provide their own implementation.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Multilevel Inheritance Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In **multilevel inheritance**, a **child class** inherits from a **parent class**, and that **child class** becomes the parent for another class. So, we have a chain like this: **Class C inherits from Class B, which inherits from Class A**.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **3. Multiple Inheritance Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In **multiple inheritance**, a class can inherit from **two or more parent classes**. This allows the child class to combine features from multiple parent classes.\n",

    "### **5. Multiple Inheritance with Same Method Name:**\n",
    "\n",
    "When you have multiple parent classes that define a method with the same name, Python follows the **Method Resolution Order (MRO)** to figure out which method to call.\n",

    "- **Multilevel Inheritance:** \n",
    "  - A class inherits from another class, and the derived class becomes the base class for another class (a **chain**).\n",
    "  - It looks like: `A -> B -> C` where **C** inherits from **B**, and **B** inherits from **A**.\n",
    "  - Example: A **Dog** (class `C`) inherits from **Mammal** (class `B`), which inherits from **Animal** (class `A`).\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Multiple Inheritance:** \n",
    "  - A class inherits from **multiple** classes simultaneously.\n",
    "  - It looks like: `A, B -> C` where **C** inherits from **A** and **B** at the same time.\n",
    "  - Example: A **Hybrid** class inherits from both **Dog** (class `B`) and **Cat** (class `C`), so it can have methods from both.\n",
