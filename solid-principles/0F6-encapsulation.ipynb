    "Alright! Let's dive into **Encapsulation**, a core concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). We'll break it down in a similar way to inheritance, making it easy to follow and understand. I’ll explain everything you need to know about encapsulation in a fun, ADHD-friendly way!\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Concepts of Encapsulation:**\n",
    "1. **Encapsulation Basics**\n",
    "2. **Attributes (Fields) and Methods (Functions)**\n",
    "3. **Access Modifiers (Private, Protected, Public)**\n",
    "4. **Getter and Setter Methods**\n",
    "5. **Private Attributes vs. Public Methods**\n",
    "6. **Encapsulation in Practice**\n",
    "7. **Why Encapsulation is Important**\n",
    "8. **Benefits of Encapsulation**\n",
    "9. **Example in Python**\n",

    "\n",
    "### **1. Encapsulation Basics:**\n",
    "- **What it is:** Encapsulation is the **bundling** of data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single **unit** or class.\n",
    "- It allows us to hide the internal details of how an object works and only expose what’s necessary. This is also known as **data hiding**.\n",
    "- **Why it matters:** Encapsulation helps **protect** the internal state of an object from being altered directly by outside code, thus preventing accidental changes and errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Attributes (Fields) and Methods (Functions):**\n",
    "- **Attributes (or Fields)** are the **data** stored in an object (like variables inside the class).\n",
    "- **Methods** are the **functions** that define the behavior of an object. These can modify or interact with the attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, brand, speed):\n",
    "        self.brand = brand  # Attribute\n",
    "        self.speed = speed  # Attribute\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def drive(self):  # Method\n",
    "        print(f\"{self.brand} is driving at {self.speed} km/h.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `brand` and `speed` are **attributes**, and `drive()` is a **method** that uses those attributes to perform an action.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Access Modifiers (Private, Protected, Public):**\n",
    "- **Access modifiers** control the visibility and accessibility of an attribute or method from outside the class.\n",
    "- **Public**: Attributes and methods that can be accessed from anywhere.\n",
    "- **Protected**: Meant to be accessible only inside the class and its subclasses.\n",
    "- **Private**: Meant to be used only within the class and cannot be accessed from outside.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Public vs Protected vs Private Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name  # Public\n",
    "        self._age = age   # Protected (by convention)\n",
    "        self.__salary = 10000  # Private (by convention)\n",
    "\n",
    "    def show_info(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"Name: {self.name}, Age: {self._age}, Salary: {self.__salary}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `name`: Public - Can be accessed from outside.\n",
    "- `_age`: Protected - By convention, meant to be used inside the class or subclasses.\n",
    "- `__salary`: Private - Can't be accessed directly from outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Getter and Setter Methods:**\n",
    "- **Getter Methods**: Allow access to private attributes.\n",
    "- **Setter Methods**: Allow modification of private attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods **encapsulate** the internal state, providing control over how attributes are accessed or modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example (Using Getters and Setters):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.__name = name  # Private\n",
    "        self.__age = age    # Private\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Getter Method\n",
    "    def get_name(self):\n",
    "        return self.__name\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Setter Method\n",
    "    def set_name(self, name):\n",
    "        if len(name) > 2:  # Some validation\n",
    "            self.__name = name\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            print(\"Name is too short!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    def get_age(self):\n",
    "        return self.__age\n",
    "\n",
    "    def set_age(self, age):\n",
    "        if age >= 0:  # Validation to ensure no negative ages\n",
    "            self.__age = age\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            print(\"Age cannot be negative.\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "person = Person(\"John\", 30)\n",
    "print(person.get_name())  # Output: John\n",
    "person.set_name(\"Jo\")     # Output: Name is too short!\n",
    "person.set_age(-5)        # Output: Age cannot be negative.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, **getters** and **setters** control access to `__name` and `__age`. Without these methods, the attributes would be directly accessible (if public), which can lead to problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Private Attributes vs. Public Methods:**\n",
    "- **Private attributes** are meant to be **protected** from direct access by the outside world. They can only be accessed or modified by **methods** in the class.\n",
    "- **Public methods** are exposed to the outside world, and they give controlled access to the private data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of **private attributes** as your **personal diary** and **public methods** as **trusted friends** who are allowed to look at your diary (with permission, of course).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class BankAccount:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, balance):\n",
    "        self.__balance = balance  # Private attribute\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def deposit(self, amount):\n",
    "        if amount > 0:\n",
    "            self.__balance += amount\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            print(\"Deposit amount must be positive.\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def withdraw(self, amount):\n",
    "        if 0 < amount <= self.__balance:\n",
    "            self.__balance -= amount\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            print(\"Insufficient funds.\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def get_balance(self):\n",
    "        return self.__balance\n",
    "\n",
    "account = BankAccount(1000)\n",
    "account.deposit(500)\n",
    "account.withdraw(200)\n",
    "print(account.get_balance())  # Output: 1300\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `__balance` is **private**, but you can interact with it using the **public methods** `deposit()`, `withdraw()`, and `get_balance()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. Encapsulation in Practice:**\n",
    "- **Why Use It:** Encapsulation is all about **hiding the complexity** and providing a **simplified interface** for interacting with objects.\n",
    "- By restricting direct access to some of an object’s components, you can **prevent accidental changes** and **control how data is accessed and modified**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Student:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, marks):\n",
    "        self.__name = name\n",
    "        self.__marks = marks\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def get_marks(self):\n",
    "        return self.__marks\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def set_marks(self, marks):\n",
    "        if 0 <= marks <= 100:  # Validation\n",
    "            self.__marks = marks\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            print(\"Marks should be between 0 and 100.\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def show_info(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"Student: {self.__name}, Marks: {self.__marks}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "student = Student(\"Alice\", 85)\n",
    "student.show_info()  # Output: Student: Alice, Marks: 85\n",
    "student.set_marks(110)  # Output: Marks should be between 0 and 100.\n",
    "student.set_marks(95)\n",
    "student.show_info()  # Output: Student: Alice, Marks: 95\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the `marks` attribute is encapsulated, meaning it can only be accessed or updated through the getter (`get_marks()`) and setter (`set_marks()`) methods, with validation on the setter.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **7. Why Encapsulation is Important:**\n",
    "- **Data Integrity:** By controlling how data is accessed and modified, encapsulation helps maintain **validity** and **consistency**.\n",
    "- **Security:** It protects sensitive data from being changed directly by external code (i.e., preventing someone from randomly changing your object’s values).\n",
    "- **Code Maintainability:** Encapsulation helps isolate changes in the code. If you want to change the internal working of an object, you only need to change it within the class and **not** in all places where it's used.\n",
    "- **Abstraction:** It allows you to hide the complexity and expose only the relevant details to the outside world.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **8. Benefits of Encapsulation:**\n",
    "- **Control:** You control how and when the data is accessed or modified. You can enforce rules and validation checks.\n",
    "- **Flexibility:** If you need to change the internal representation of an object (e.g., change how data is stored), you can do it without affecting external code, as long as the **public interface** (methods) stays the same.\n",
    "- **Prevents Errors:** By protecting internal state and offering controlled access via methods, it reduces the risk of invalid data changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **9. Example in Python:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Employee:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, salary):\n",
    "        self.__name = name  # Private attribute\n",
    "        self.__salary = salary  # Private attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "    def get_name(self):\n",
    "        return self.__name\n",
    "\n",
    "    def get_salary(self):\n",
    "        return self.__salary\n",
    "\n",
    "    def set_salary(self, salary):\n",
    "        if salary > 0:\n",
    "            self.__salary = salary\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            print(\"Salary must be positive.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    def show_info(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"Employee: {self.__name}, Salary: ${self.__salary}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "employee = Employee(\"John\", 5000)\n",
    "employee.show_info()  # Output: Employee: John, Salary: $5000\n",
    "\n",
    "# Changing salary using setter\n",
    "employee.set_salary(6000)\n",
    "employee.show_info()  # Output: Employee: John, Salary: $6000\n",
    "\n",
    "# Trying to set invalid salary\n",
    "employee.set_salary(-1000)  # Output: Salary must be positive.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
