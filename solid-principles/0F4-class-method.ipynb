    "### Understanding **Class Methods** in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "A **class method** is a method that is bound to the class rather than an instance of the class. Class methods are similar to static methods but they take a **class** as their first argument (usually named `cls`), instead of an instance (which would typically be referred to as `self`). Class methods can modify the class state or access class-level data, and they are defined using the `@classmethod` decorator.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features:\n",
    "1. **First argument is the class (`cls`)**: Unlike instance methods that take `self`, class methods take `cls` to operate on class-level attributes.\n",
    "2. **Access or modify class-level data**: Class methods are used when you need to interact with class-level variables or need to perform actions that affect the class as a whole, rather than just a single instance.\n",
    "3. **Can be called on the class or instance**: While class methods are typically used on the class itself, they can also be called from an instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Class Methods?\n",
    "- **Factory methods**: Class methods are often used to create instances in a more flexible way, such as creating objects from alternative constructors.\n",
    "- **Accessing or modifying class-level state**: Class methods allow manipulation of class-level variables that apply to all instances of the class.\n",
    "- **Inheritance and Polymorphism**: Class methods can be overridden in subclasses, allowing them to interact with class-level data in more flexible ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Beginner Level: Basic Example of a Class Method**\n",
    "\n",
    "At the simplest level, a class method can be used to modify or interact with class-level data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1: Modifying Class-level Data\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    total_people = 0  # Class-level variable\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        Person.total_people += 1  # Increment class-level counter\n",
    "\n",
    "    @classmethod\n",
    "    def get_total_people(cls):\n",
    "        return cls.total_people  # Access class-level data\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage\n",
    "p1 = Person(\"Alice\")\n",
    "p2 = Person(\"Bob\")\n",
    "p3 = Person(\"Charlie\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calling the class method\n",
    "print(Person.get_total_people())  # Output: 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- `total_people` is a class-level variable that keeps track of the number of `Person` objects created.\n",
    "- The class method `get_total_people` accesses this class-level variable and returns the total count of people.\n",
    "- The method is called on the **class** (`Person.get_total_people()`), not on an instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Intermediate Level: Class Methods for Alternative Constructors (Factory Methods)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Class methods are commonly used to provide alternate constructors, allowing for more flexible ways to create instances of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 2: Alternative Constructor using a Class Method\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Product:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, price):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.price = price\n",
    "\n",
    "    @classmethod\n",
    "    def from_discount(cls, name, price, discount):\n",
    "        # Alternative constructor to create a Product with a discounted price\n",
    "        discounted_price = price * (1 - discount)\n",
    "        return cls(name, discounted_price)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage\n",
    "product1 = Product(\"Laptop\", 1000)\n",
    "print(product1.name, product1.price)  # Output: Laptop 1000\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using the class method to create a discounted product\n",
    "product2 = Product.from_discount(\"Laptop\", 1000, 0.1)\n",
    "print(product2.name, product2.price)  # Output: Laptop 900.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- `from_discount` is a class method that serves as an **alternative constructor** to create a `Product` instance with a discounted price.\n",
    "- It uses `cls` to call the constructor of the class (`cls(name, discounted_price)`), which ensures that the correct class is used, even if this method is inherited by subclasses.\n",
    "- The class method provides an easy way to create objects with customized logic (such as discounts) without directly using the primary constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Advanced Level: Class Methods for Handling Inheritance**\n",
    "\n",
    "Class methods are particularly useful when dealing with inheritance. A class method can work with the class itself, so even if it's called from a subclass, it will refer to the correct class (`cls`) at runtime, which makes it more flexible than static methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 3: Class Method with Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    species = \"Generic Animal\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "    @classmethod\n",
    "    def get_species(cls):\n",
    "        return cls.species\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    species = \"Dog\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "    species = \"Cat\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage\n",
    "animal = Animal(\"Generic Animal\")\n",
    "dog = Dog(\"Rex\")\n",
    "cat = Cat(\"Whiskers\")\n",
    "\n",
    "print(Animal.get_species())  # Output: Generic Animal\n",
    "print(Dog.get_species())     # Output: Dog\n",
    "print(Cat.get_species())     # Output: Cat\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- The class method `get_species` uses `cls` to access the `species` variable, which is defined at the class level.\n",
    "- When called from `Animal`, it returns `\"Generic Animal\"`, but when called from `Dog` or `Cat`, it correctly returns the species for that subclass (`\"Dog\"` or `\"Cat\"`).\n",
    "- This demonstrates how class methods work with inheritance and polymorphism. The class method is able to work with both the parent class and subclasses, making it flexible and allowing for dynamic behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Expert Level: Class Methods for Factory Methods and Inheritance**\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, you might use class methods to manage instances across multiple subclasses. This is common when you have a base class with multiple subclasses, and you want to handle object creation through a common interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 4: Complex Factory Method with Multiple Subclasses\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    @classmethod\n",
    "    def create(cls, name):\n",
    "        raise NotImplementedError(\"Subclass must implement this method\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    @classmethod\n",
    "    def create(cls, name):\n",
    "        return f\"Creating a Dog named {name}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "    @classmethod\n",
    "    def create(cls, name):\n",
    "        return f\"Creating a Cat named {name}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage\n",
    "dog = Dog.create(\"Rex\")\n",
    "cat = Cat.create(\"Whiskers\")\n",
    "\n",
    "print(dog)  # Output: Creating a Dog named Rex\n",
    "print(cat)  # Output: Creating a Cat named Whiskers\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- The `create` method is defined as a class method in the base class `Animal`, but it is **overridden** in each subclass (`Dog` and `Cat`).\n",
    "- The `create` method is a **factory method** that handles object creation based on the subclass it is called from.\n",
    "- Each subclass provides its own version of the `create` method, allowing for polymorphic behavior (i.e., different behavior based on the actual class that calls it).\n",
    "  \n",
    "### **5. Expert Level: Managing Class-level State in Complex Applications**\n",
    "\n",
    "Class methods can be used to manage complex class-level state, especially in situations where you need to ensure that all instances of the class behave in a certain way or are created in a particular manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 5: Managing Class-Level State\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Library:\n",
    "    books = []  # Class-level list to track all books in the library\n",
    "\n",
    "    @classmethod\n",
    "    def add_book(cls, book):\n",
    "        cls.books.append(book)\n",
    "\n",
    "    @classmethod\n",
    "    def get_books(cls):\n",
    "        return cls.books\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage\n",
    "Library.add_book(\"The Great Gatsby\")\n",
    "Library.add_book(\"1984\")\n",
    "Library.add_book(\"To Kill a Mockingbird\")\n",
    "\n",
    "print(Library.get_books())  # Output: ['The Great Gatsby', '1984', 'To Kill a Mockingbird']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- The class-level variable `books` keeps track of all books in the library.\n",
    "- The `add_book` and `get_books` class methods are used to modify and access the `books` list.\n",
    "- This example shows how class methods can be used to manage class-level state across all instances of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Summary of Key Points**:\n",
    "- **Class methods** are bound to the class and take the class itself (`cls`) as their first parameter. They are used for class-level operations or creating alternate constructors.\n",
    "- **Use cases**:\n",
    "  - Accessing or modifying class-level data (like class variables).\n",
    "  - Factory methods to create instances in alternative ways.\n",
    "  - Managing inheritance behavior (class methods can be inherited and can access data for subclasses).\n",
    "- **When to use**: When you need to perform operations that involve the class itself, not an individual instance, or when you want to define behavior that is shared across all instances of the class (but is still bound to the class).\n",
    "\n",
    "By understanding how class methods work, you can design flexible, scalable, and maintainable code that works well with class-level data and inheritance hierarchies."
