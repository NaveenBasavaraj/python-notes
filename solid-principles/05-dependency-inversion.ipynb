    "### The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) is one of the five SOLID principles in object-oriented design. It focuses on reducing the coupling between high-level and low-level modules by introducing abstractions. Hereâ€™s how it works in the context of your example:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Aspects of DIP:\n",
    "High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.\n",
    "Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.\n",
    "Breakdown in the Context of the Provided Code:\n",
    "1. The Problem (Violation of DIP):\n",
    "In the initial version of the code (which is commented out in Research):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# def __init__(self, relationships):\n",
    "#     relations = relationships.relations\n",
    "#     for r in relations:\n",
    "#         if r[0].name == 'John' and r[1] == Relationship.PARENT:\n",
    "#             print(f'John has a child called {r[2].name}.')\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, the Research class is directly depending on the internal implementation of the Relationships class. Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Research class is tightly coupled to the Relationships class's relations list.\n",
    "If you change the internal structure of Relationships (e.g., change how relations are stored), it would break the Research class, violating the Dependency Inversion Principle.\n",
    "In this case, Research is the high-level module, and Relationships is the low-level module. The Research class should not directly depend on how Relationships is implemented, but it does so here.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. How DIP is Implemented in the Code:\n",
    "To follow the Dependency Inversion Principle, the Research class is refactored to depend on an abstraction of the RelationshipBrowser interface rather than directly on Relationships. This way, Research doesn't depend on how relationships are stored or manipulated internally.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class RelationshipBrowser:\n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def find_all_children_of(self, name): \n",
    "        pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "RelationshipBrowser is an abstraction that defines what high-level modules (like Research) can use. It doesn't care about how the relationships are stored or retrieved, just that it can find all children of a given name.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Research:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, browser):\n",
    "        for p in browser.find_all_children_of(\"John\"):\n",
    "            print(f'John has a child called {p}')\n",
    "```\n",
    "The Research class now depends on the abstraction (RelationshipBrowser), not the concrete implementation (Relationships).\n",
    "Research can interact with any class that implements the RelationshipBrowser interface, which decouples it from the specific details of how relationships are stored.\n",
    "### 3. Benefits:\n",
    "Flexibility: You can now easily swap out the Relationships class with another implementation that also implements RelationshipBrowser. For example, you could have a DatabaseRelationships class that retrieves relationships from a database or a FileRelationships class that stores relationships in a file. As long as the new class implements the RelationshipBrowser interface, the Research class can work with it without modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reduced coupling: Research is no longer dependent on the Relationships class's internal data structure (relations). It only depends on the contract (the RelationshipBrowser interface), which allows for easier changes and maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "By introducing the RelationshipBrowser interface, the code adheres to the Dependency Inversion Principle, as the high-level module (Research) no longer depends on the low-level module's concrete details (Relationships). Instead, both depend on the abstraction (RelationshipBrowser), which enables easier code maintenance, flexibility, and adherence to SOLID principles.\n",
