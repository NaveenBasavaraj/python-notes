    "### Python `property` Class: A Comprehensive Guide from Beginner to Advanced\n",
    "\n",
    "The `property` class in Python provides a way to manage attributes of a class in a more controlled manner. It allows you to define methods that can be accessed like regular attributes, but with the added benefit of encapsulation and validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Beginner: What is `property` and Why is it Useful?**\n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, the `property` class is a way to define **getter**, **setter**, and **deleter** methods in Python while keeping the interface looking like normal attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, in Python, attributes are directly accessed and modified. However, in some cases, you want to control the access or modification of these attributes — for instance, to compute a value lazily, enforce restrictions on setting values, or track when an attribute is accessed or modified. \n",
    "\n",
    "With `property`, you can define methods for these tasks without requiring users of your class to call them explicitly as methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Simple Example of `property`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Circle:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, radius):\n",
    "        self._radius = radius\n",
    "\n",
    "    @property\n",
    "    def radius(self):\n",
    "        return self._radius\n",
    "\n",
    "    @radius.setter\n",
    "    def radius(self, value):\n",
    "        if value < 0:\n",
    "            raise ValueError(\"Radius cannot be negative\")\n",
    "        self._radius = value\n",
    "\n",
    "    @radius.deleter\n",
    "    def radius(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Deleting radius\")\n",
    "        del self._radius\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage\n",
    "c = Circle(5)\n",
    "print(c.radius)  # Calls the getter, output: 5\n",
    "\n",
    "c.radius = 10     # Calls the setter\n",
    "print(c.radius)   # Calls the getter, output: 10\n",
    "\n",
    "del c.radius      # Calls the deleter\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Getter (`@property`)**: This allows you to define a method that retrieves the value of an attribute, but it’s accessed as though it were a regular attribute.\n",
    "- **Setter (`@property_name.setter`)**: This allows you to define a method to set the value of an attribute, with additional logic or validation.\n",
    "- **Deleter (`@property_name.deleter`)**: This allows you to define logic that runs when an attribute is deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above:\n",
    "- `@property` makes the `radius` method act like an attribute.\n",
    "- `@radius.setter` adds a way to control how the radius can be set (with validation).\n",
    "- `@radius.deleter` gives you control over what happens when the radius is deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Intermediate: Understanding the Mechanics of `property`**\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the mechanics of `property`, let's break it down:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **How it works**: `property` turns a method into an attribute-like object. When you define a method with `@property`, Python binds it to the object as if it were an attribute.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - **Getter**: You access the method via an attribute, and it gets called automatically.\n",
    "  - **Setter**: You assign a value to the attribute, which calls the setter method.\n",
    "  - **Deleter**: When the attribute is deleted with `del`, the deleter method is invoked.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Controlling Access to Internal Data\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Temperature:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, celsius):\n",
    "        self._celsius = celsius\n",
    "\n",
    "    @property\n",
    "    def celsius(self):\n",
    "        return self._celsius\n",
    "\n",
    "    @property\n",
    "    def fahrenheit(self):\n",
    "        return self._celsius * 9 / 5 + 32\n",
    "\n",
    "    @fahrenheit.setter\n",
    "    def fahrenheit(self, value):\n",
    "        self._celsius = (value - 32) * 5 / 9\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage\n",
    "t = Temperature(25)\n",
    "print(t.celsius)    # 25\n",
    "print(t.fahrenheit)  # 77.0\n",
    "\n",
    "# Setting fahrenheit updates celsius automatically\n",
    "t.fahrenheit = 86\n",
    "print(t.celsius)    # 30.0\n",
    "print(t.fahrenheit)  # 86.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here:\n",
    "- `celsius` is a simple getter for accessing the value.\n",
    "- `fahrenheit` is a calculated value based on the internal `celsius` attribute.\n",
    "- We use `@fahrenheit.setter` to allow setting the value of `fahrenheit`, which internally updates the `celsius` attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Advanced: Using `property` for More Complex Scenarios**\n",
    "\n",
    "At an advanced level, you can use `property` for various purposes beyond simple validation or computed attributes. You can use it for caching, complex data transformations, or tracking access to attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: **Lazy Loading (Caching)**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to calculate a property only when it's needed (and avoid recalculating it every time), you can use `property` for caching.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class DataProcessor:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, data):\n",
    "        self._data = data\n",
    "        self._processed_data = None\n",
    "\n",
    "    @property\n",
    "    def processed_data(self):\n",
    "        if self._processed_data is None:\n",
    "            print(\"Processing data...\")\n",
    "            self._processed_data = [x * 2 for x in self._data]  # Simulating heavy processing\n",
    "        return self._processed_data\n",
    "\n",
    "    @processed_data.setter\n",
    "    def processed_data(self, value):\n",
    "        self._processed_data = value\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage\n",
    "dp = DataProcessor([1, 2, 3])\n",
    "print(dp.processed_data)  # Calls the getter and processes data (first time)\n",
    "\n",
    "dp.processed_data = [2, 4, 6]  # Allows setting the processed data\n",
    "print(dp.processed_data)  # Uses the cached value, no processing\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here:\n",
    "- The `processed_data` property calculates and caches the result only when it is first accessed (lazy loading).\n",
    "- Subsequent accesses return the cached data without recalculating it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: **Tracking Access**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use `property` to track when an attribute is accessed or modified, which can be useful for logging, debugging, or monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self._name = name\n",
    "        self._age = age\n",
    "\n",
    "    @property\n",
    "    def name(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Accessing name...\")\n",
    "        return self._name\n",
    "\n",
    "    @property\n",
    "    def age(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Accessing age...\")\n",
    "        return self._age\n",
    "\n",
    "    @age.setter\n",
    "    def age(self, value):\n",
    "        if value < 0:\n",
    "            raise ValueError(\"Age cannot be negative\")\n",
    "        print(\"Setting age...\")\n",
    "        self._age = value\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage\n",
    "p = Person(\"Alice\", 30)\n",
    "print(p.name)  # Accesses the name, prints message\n",
    "print(p.age)   # Accesses the age, prints message\n",
    "p.age = 35     # Sets a new age, prints message\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Advanced: `property` with `__getattr__` and `__setattr__`**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can combine `property` with the `__getattr__` and `__setattr__` special methods for even more control over how attributes are handled. While `property` works with direct attribute access, `__getattr__` and `__setattr__` let you intercept any attribute lookup and assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Dynamic Properties Using `__getattr__`\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class DynamicAttributes:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self._data = {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30}\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __getattr__(self, name):\n",
    "        if name in self._data:\n",
    "            return self._data[name]\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            raise AttributeError(f\"Attribute '{name}' not found\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage\n",
    "obj = DynamicAttributes()\n",
    "print(obj.name)  # Accesses the 'name' attribute dynamically\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `__getattr__` intercepts access to attributes that don’t exist in the instance, providing dynamic behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Summary of Key Points**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Property** is used to define getter, setter, and deleter methods while making the interface look like regular attributes.\n",
    "- **Getter** allows controlled access to attributes.\n",
    "- **Setter** allows controlled modification of attributes.\n",
    "- **Deleter** allows controlled deletion of attributes.\n",
    "- `property` can be used for **lazy loading**, **validation**, **caching**, **logging**, and more.\n",
    "- It provides a clean, object-oriented way to encapsulate logic around attribute access and modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `property` makes your code more maintainable, readable, and flexible, especially when you want to expose computed or validated attributes while keeping the interface clean and intuitive."
