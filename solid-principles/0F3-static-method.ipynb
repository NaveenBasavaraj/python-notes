    "### Understanding **Static Methods** in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "A **static method** is a method that belongs to a class rather than an instance of the class. It does not operate on an instance of the class (i.e., it doesn't access or modify the object's state) and does not have access to the `self` or `cls` parameters that are typical of instance or class methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Static methods are defined using the `@staticmethod` decorator and can be called on the class itself or on an instance of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Beginner Level: Simple Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "A static method is generally used when you need a function that does not depend on the state of the instance but still belongs to the class logically. You might use a static method for utility functions that perform an operation related to the class but do not need to modify any class or instance attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1: Basic Static Method\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MathOperations:\n",
    "    @staticmethod\n",
    "    def add(a, b):\n",
    "        return a + b\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage\n",
    "result = MathOperations.add(5, 3)\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: 8\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- The `add` method is defined as a static method using `@staticmethod`.\n",
    "- The method takes two parameters (`a` and `b`) and returns their sum.\n",
    "- Notice that `add` is called directly on the class `MathOperations`, not on an instance of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Intermediate Level: Using Static Methods for Utility Functions**\n",
    "\n",
    "Static methods can be used to encapsulate utility functions that are related to the class, even if they don't interact with the class or instance state. It helps to logically group these functions in a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 2: Temperature Converter\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we want a class that handles temperature conversion, but the conversion function doesn't need to access any instance-specific data.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class TemperatureConverter:\n",
    "    @staticmethod\n",
    "    def celsius_to_fahrenheit(celsius):\n",
    "        return (celsius * 9 / 5) + 32\n",
    "\n",
    "    @staticmethod\n",
    "    def fahrenheit_to_celsius(fahrenheit):\n",
    "        return (fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage\n",
    "temp_in_celsius = 25\n",
    "temp_in_fahrenheit = TemperatureConverter.celsius_to_fahrenheit(temp_in_celsius)\n",
    "print(f\"{temp_in_celsius}°C is equal to {temp_in_fahrenheit}°F\")\n",
    "\n",
    "temp_in_fahrenheit = 77\n",
    "temp_in_celsius = TemperatureConverter.fahrenheit_to_celsius(temp_in_fahrenheit)\n",
    "print(f\"{temp_in_fahrenheit}°F is equal to {temp_in_celsius}°C\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- Both `celsius_to_fahrenheit` and `fahrenheit_to_celsius` are static methods because they are utility functions that don't require access to any instance data, only the arguments passed to them.\n",
    "- You can use the static methods directly on the class, without creating an instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Advanced Level: Static Methods for Factory Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "A more advanced use case of static methods is when you want to create \"factory\" methods that generate instances of the class in different ways. These methods are static because they don't require the instance's state to create new objects but are still logically related to the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 3: Factory Method for Creating Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Product:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, price):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.price = price\n",
    "\n",
    "    @staticmethod\n",
    "    def create_discounted_product(name, price, discount):\n",
    "        discounted_price = price * (1 - discount)\n",
    "        return Product(name, discounted_price)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage\n",
    "product1 = Product(\"Laptop\", 1000)\n",
    "print(f\"{product1.name}: ${product1.price}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using the factory method\n",
    "product2 = Product.create_discounted_product(\"Laptop\", 1000, 0.1)\n",
    "print(f\"{product2.name}: ${product2.price}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- `create_discounted_product` is a static method that serves as a **factory method** to create `Product` objects with a discounted price.\n",
    "- The factory method doesn’t require an instance of `Product` to be created; it only requires the input data (name, price, and discount) and returns a new `Product` instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Expert Level: Static Methods and Class-Level Logic**\n",
    "\n",
    "Static methods can also be used for class-level logic that doesn't require any instance data, but the static method operates at the class level, possibly interacting with class variables or handling class-wide tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 4: Static Method with Class-Level Data\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Employee:\n",
    "    employee_count = 0  # Class variable to track the number of employees\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, position):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.position = position\n",
    "        Employee.employee_count += 1\n",
    "\n",
    "    @staticmethod\n",
    "    def get_employee_count():\n",
    "        return Employee.employee_count\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage\n",
    "emp1 = Employee(\"Alice\", \"Developer\")\n",
    "emp2 = Employee(\"Bob\", \"Manager\")\n",
    "emp3 = Employee(\"Charlie\", \"Designer\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calling the static method to get the number of employees\n",
    "print(f\"Total number of employees: {Employee.get_employee_count()}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- The class `Employee` tracks the number of employee instances created using the class variable `employee_count`.\n",
    "- The static method `get_employee_count` provides access to the `employee_count` without needing an instance of `Employee`. It directly refers to the class variable and returns the total number of employees.\n",
    "- This is useful for situations where you want to expose class-level data or behavior but do not need to interact with any instance-level data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Advanced Use Case: Static Methods in Multiple Class Hierarchies**\n",
    "\n",
    "You might have a scenario where a static method can be shared across different classes in an inheritance hierarchy. Static methods are inherited by subclasses, but they are still called on the class itself rather than instances, which can be useful for utility methods that apply to all classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 5: Static Method in a Class Hierarchy\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    @staticmethod\n",
    "    def is_mammal():\n",
    "        return True\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    @staticmethod\n",
    "    def bark():\n",
    "        print(\"Woof!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "    @staticmethod\n",
    "    def meow():\n",
    "        print(\"Meow!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage\n",
    "print(Animal.is_mammal())  # Inherited static method from Animal class\n",
    "Dog.bark()  # Static method specific to Dog class\n",
    "Cat.meow()  # Static method specific to Cat class\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- The `is_mammal` static method is inherited by both `Dog` and `Cat` from the `Animal` class.\n",
    "- Each subclass can define its own static methods (`bark` for `Dog`, `meow` for `Cat`), but they can also use static methods from the parent class like `is_mammal`.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Static methods in this case are useful for sharing functionality that applies across all subclasses but is not tied to any particular instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Summary of Key Points**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Definition**: A static method is a method that belongs to the class, not instances of the class. It does not take `self` or `cls` as its first parameter.\n",
    "2. **Use Cases**:\n",
    "   - For utility functions that do not need access to instance-specific data.\n",
    "   - For factory methods that create instances of the class.\n",
    "   - For class-level functionality that does not depend on instance-specific data but might interact with class-level data.\n",
    "3. **When to Use**:\n",
    "   - When the method doesn't need access to the instance (`self`) or the class (`cls`), but still logically belongs to the class.\n",
    "   - When the function is related to the class but doesn't modify or interact with instance-level data.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using static methods, you can logically group methods inside a class while avoiding unnecessary dependency on class instances, making your code cleaner and more modular."
