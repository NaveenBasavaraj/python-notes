    "## Open-Closed Principle (OCP).\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "The Open-Closed Principle states that a class, module, or function should be:\n",
    "\n",
    "Open for extension: Allow new behavior to be added without modifying the existing code.\n",
    "Closed for modification: Prevent changes to the existing code, minimizing the risk of introducing bugs or breaking existing functionality.\n",
    "Key Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extensibility: New behavior can be added without altering the existing codebase.\n",
    "- Stability: Existing code remains unchanged, reducing the likelihood of introducing defects or disrupting current functionality.\n",
    "- Abstraction: Abstract interfaces or base classes define the contract, allowing derived classes to extend behavior without modifying the original code.\n",
    "Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reduced Risk: Minimizes the risk of introducing bugs or breaking existing functionality when adding new features.\n",
    "- Improved Maintainability: Eases maintenance by allowing developers to add new behavior without modifying existing code.\n",
    "- Enhanced Flexibility: Enables developers to adapt the system to changing requirements without compromising stability.\n",
    "- Simplified Testing: Reduces testing efforts, as new behavior can be tested independently without affecting existing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Design Patterns and Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "Several design patterns and techniques support the Open-Closed Principle:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inheritance: Derived classes inherit behavior from base classes, extending functionality without modifying the original code.\n",
    "- Polymorphism: Objects of different classes can be treated as instances of a common superclass, enabling extensibility through polymorphic behavior.\n",
    "- Interfaces: Abstract interfaces define contracts, allowing classes to implement specific behaviors without modifying the interface.\n",
    "- Composition: Composite objects contain collections of other objects, enabling extensibility through addition or removal of components.\n",
    "- Dependency Injection: Dependencies are injected into objects, rather than being hardcoded, facilitating extensibility and flexibility.\n",
    "Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "- Shape Hierarchy: A shape hierarchy with an abstract Shape class and concrete shapes like Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle. New shapes can be added without modifying the existing code.\n",
    "- Payment Gateway: A payment gateway system with an abstract PaymentGateway interface and concrete implementations like PayPal, Stripe, and BankTransfer. New payment gateways can be added without modifying the existing code.\n",
    "- Logger: A logger system with an abstract Logger interface and concrete implementations like ConsoleLogger, FileLogger, and DatabaseLogger. New loggers can be added without modifying the existing code."
